# In Python, a list is created by placing elements inside square brackets [] , separated by commas.
# A list can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string, etc.).
# A list can also have another list as an item. This is called a nested list.
valuesInList = [1, 1.1, "Python", 56, "Testing"]

# insert() -> Add an value at some index
valuesInList.insert(3, "Automation Testing") # Automation Testing will be added at the 3rd index of list
print(valuesInList) # [1, 1.1, 'Python', 'Automation Testing', 56, 'Testing']
