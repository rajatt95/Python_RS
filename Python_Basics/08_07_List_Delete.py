# In Python, a list is created by placing elements inside square brackets [] , separated by commas.
# A list can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string, etc.).
# A list can also have another list as an item. This is called a nested list.
valuesInList = [1, 1.1, "Python", 56, "Testing"]

# del -> Delete the value at given index
del valuesInList[0]
print(valuesInList) # [1.1, 'Python', 56, 'Testing']
